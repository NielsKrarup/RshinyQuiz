## R Markdown

$$
\int_0^1 t^{z_1 -1}(1-t)^{z_2-1}dt = B(z_1, z_2) 
$$
$B$ has the property of 
$$
B(m,n) = \frac{\Gamma(m)\Gamma(n)}{\Gamma(m+n)}
$$

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
